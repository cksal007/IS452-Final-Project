# IS452-Final-Project
My repository for IS 452 FA2019 Final Project Deliverables Submission.

## Project Overview
This project uses a dataset containing NBA players and statstical information. The code gets you the highest-scoring team, youngest team, or oldest team possible with the standard that team is composed of two guards, two forwards, and two centers. Much of the code is used to retrieve the top 2 of each of the categories for a specified position.

## Use
At the end of the code, it asks for an user input of which team you want to see. There are three options that you can choose from. If the user inputs an invalid response, the program will keep asking for input until a valid one is entered.

## Graph
The program also generates a bar graoh that can be used to compare the PPG (points per game) of players in the old team vs. the young team. The side by side bar graph gives a clear visual in this comparison.
